# gulag-web.js
nodejs frontend implementation for cmyui's gulag

## requirements
`NODE JS LTS`
`MYSQL (tested w/ 8.0.20)`
`A REVERSE PROXY (test w/ nginx)`

## notes
installation is done in ubuntu 18.05 but you can make this work on windows or ubuntu 20 (ubuntu 20 is known to have issues with nginx and osu, i'd preferably not use it) and probably even other linux distros but since gulag is recommended to be used on ubuntu 18 i recommend using that.

## installation

```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs-dev node-gyp libssl1.0-dev npm

```
